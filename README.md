**About the content**

This is a teaching materials about the use of alpha and beta diversity indices for the study of community structure based on metabarcoding data. 
The OTUs used in these examples are derived from experimental data. In contrast, the relative, sample abundances and metadata were generated manually and have no ecological significance. The aim is to have simple examples to understand how the indices work and how they can be used in combination.
